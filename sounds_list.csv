DEAD HORSE BAY Collage.wav,165490,"This is a very specific place, so may not be useful for most beach ambience needs.
Dead Horse Bay, Brooklyn, is a little known urban curiosity:  it is a former garbage dump, and most of what remains is mid-century glass littering the beach and shoreline.  Nature has begun to take it over.  This was recorded on a late Spring afternoon.
This recording is a collage, pieced together as seamlessly as possible:  you can hear the water lapping at low tide, at the bottles, close perspective; water foul from shoreline; moving away from shoreline, the sound of crunching glass underfoot, some light wind; sea birds, some light conversation.
Stereo recording.  Unprocessed.
If you want to see the visuals which accompany these sounds, here are photographs, with this sound file, plus original musical accompaniment:
